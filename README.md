# Plant Parenthood

Welcome to Plant Parenthood, your go-to app for all your plant care needs! This application is designed to help you track the watering schedule of your plants, access guides, tips, and troubleshooting resources, and connect with a vibrant community of plant enthusiasts through a discussion chat.

Full disclaimer, this project is a requirement for our Mobile Development class in college. While we did receive positive critique for our work, some parts remain incomplete.

This monorepo serves as the codebase for the project including several codes organized in the following folders:

### Folders

- [Admin](#admin)
- [Mobile app](#mobile-app)
- [PHP](#php)
- [Website](#website)

### Admin

The Admin folder contains **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** code for managing the content of our Plant Parenthood application. This system manages the various data used in our application such as the plants, tips, users, and reports. Please note that the code in this folder is incomplete and under active development.

### Mobile app

The Mobile App folder contains the code for our Plant Parenthood mobile application. The app is written in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and is meant to be compiled in Apache Cordova. The app is designed to allow users to learn to grow their plants, be reminded of their watering and encourage helpful community participation.

### PHP

The **PHP** folder contains the complete backend code for our Plant Parenthood application. This PHP backend handles essential functions for the communication between the front-end interfaces and the database. Through the APIs, the PHP backend allows the mobile app and the admin section to access and manipulate data related to plants, tips, users, and reports.

### Website

The Website folder contains the code for the Plant Parenthood application's website, where the app is showcased. The website is built using **Next.js 13, TypeScript, and SCSS**. It serves as a platform to introduce visitors to the features and functionality of Plant Parenthood.

The website is deployed at [here](https://mobile-dev-finals.vercel.app). Feel free to explore the website to learn more about the app and its capabilities.
